## Growth Managing Commands

### Cutting Old Branches

Once you need to clean up all local copies of branches which was already
removed from the master repository:

<pre class='brush: bash'>git remote prune origin</pre>

### Cloning or Updating Massive Repo

If you want to checkout a massive repository, it could cause some memory
problems of the type: `fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly`. In such a
situations one should better increment `http.postBuffer`, turn off
compression, do a shallow pull, followed by residual pull, followed by
normal pull:

<pre class='brush: bash'>
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
git config --global core.compression 0
git clone --depth 1 repo_uri
git fetch --unshallow
git pull --all
</pre>
