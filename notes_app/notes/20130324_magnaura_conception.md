<!-- Summary: Description of how the Magnaura should look on completion. -->

## What will be here?

I'm going to develop some project and write down some thoughts which I would have along it.
Main purpose: is to help me to stay focused on the direction of the project.

## What is this project about?

In general, it's about how to improve technology. But for begin it's about some fluid simulation problem (like Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium).

## What does exist?

[http://vle-calc.com](http://vle-calc.com) -- this is something which I want to be close to, but not precisely.
I want my prototype to be more like this [http://vle-java.sourceforge.net](http://vle-java.sourceforge.net).

The difference: at vle-java you clearly understand what's going on under the hood.

## What is the flavour of my solution?

I want to make it as simple as possible for researcher to contribute in it. Like in the wikipedia. Why? Researchers are not very good in generic programming on average, but they know a lot of formulas, which could be useful.

## How parties should win from this solution?

__Industry__: access to the most fresh simulation formulas.

__Researchers__: convenient access to the experimental data generated so far and possibility to share you breaking discovery with industry as fast, as possible. You don't have to write a paper, you just put your new awesome equation into the system and it will automatically label it with your name.

__Area__: in chain "researcher -- paper publishing -- industry" we remove unnecessary middle link. This hopefully would boost up the progress.
