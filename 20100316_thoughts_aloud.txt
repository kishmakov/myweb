## On Lie Groups

* Let \(G\) be a [Lie group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group) and \(H\) be its closed subgroup, then \(H\) its Lie subgroup.
* Not every group is a Lie group.

## On Dimension

Physically speaking, existence of correlation between \(X\) and \(Y\) imply drop in dimension of phase space of  \((X, Y)\) couples.

## On Asymptotics

Once I was sitting at biology lesson. There was some talk about some genealogy with rabbits used as an illustration. At the moment I felt in a day dream an saw such a model. Suppose we have idealistic infinite valley, covered by super juicy grass. Let us imagine that we have a specific specie of rabbits which only needed this juicy grass for their living. In such a setting this infinite valley looks like a paradise for such a creatures.

But what will happen if put, say, 10 couples of this rabbits in this idealistic world? Population of the specie could be approximated as some exponent of the form \(Ac^t\) where \(c\) is defined by reproductivity function and related parameters. At the same time, areal of habitation of these rabbits would be bounded by radius \(vt\) where \(v\) is the speed by which they could travel over the valley. Finally we end up with density of rabbits bounded by
$$\frac{Ac^t}{\pi v^2 t^2}$$
from bellow. This essentially mean that whatever these rabbits would do, their "overcrowding" would inevitably grow. At some moment density value overcome grass recovery threshold and it would lead first to starvation and then to death. Such a sad fact about seemingly optimistic world.
