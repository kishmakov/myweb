=== Summary ===
Sketchy thoughts on math subjects.
=== Body ===
1. Let \(G\) be a [Lie group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group) and \(H\) be its closed subgroup, then \(H\) its Lie subgroup.
2. Not every group is a Lie group.
3. Physically speaking, existence of correlation between \(X\) and \(Y\) imply drop in dimension of phase space of  \((X, Y)\) couples.
