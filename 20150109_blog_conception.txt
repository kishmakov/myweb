## What is it for?

This "blog engine" is supposed to be a transparent tool for:

1. building a big _vision_ from small strokes in incremental manner
2. collecting random _observations_

One could think about this engine as hybrid between blog and wiki. It

### Building

When one is doing a long lasting project with either complicated or
not fully invented structure, it is necessary to have a communication
tool which helps to accumulate gained vision of the structure.

Since vision doesn't fully appear in a moment, engine should be flexible
enough to suffer from compulsory transformations. It should also tracks all
changes since creation is messy and rewritten versions could contain valuable
information.

### Collecting

In traditional blogging one are supposed to generate "linear increment"
of stuff by pushing completed postings at the top of the "postings line".
Such an approach is convenient for a model where posting value is bound to
time.

This engine is oriented on "random, locally convergent, increment" of stuff.
By locally convergent it is meant that frequency of posting updates is
decreasing with time. So basically it is like wiki for articles which are
supposed to become pretty finished in a small number of updates.

### Aesthetics
