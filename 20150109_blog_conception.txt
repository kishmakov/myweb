## What is it for?

This "blog engine" is supposed to be a transparent tool for:

1. building a big _vision_ from small strokes in incremental manner
2. collecting random _observations_

One could think about this engine as a hybrid between blog and wiki.

### Building

When one is doing a long lasting project with either complicated or
not fully invented structure, it is necessary to have a communication
tool which would help to accumulate gained vision of the structure.

Since vision doesn't fully appear in a moment, engine should be flexible
enough to suffer from compulsory transformations. It should also track all
changes since creation is messy and rewritten versions can contain valuable
information.

### Collecting

In traditional blogging one is supposed to generate "linear increment"
of stuff by pushing completed postings at the top of the "postings line".
Such an approach is convenient for a model where posting value is bound to
time.

This engine is oriented on "random, locally convergent, increment" of stuff.
By locally convergent it is meant that frequency of posting updates is
decreasing with time. So basically it is like wiki for articles which are
supposed to become pretty finished in a small number of updates.

### Aesthetics

Engine is supposed to be a "mentally thin thing". It should minimally bother
a user. No web-interfaces for editing, no data bases for storage. Just a
directory with a bunch of text files which are stored in a git repository.
One could `grep` them, `sed` them and use his favorite editor to update them.

Every text file is basically just a [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
file with support for TeX and syntax highlighting. Tags are supported for
more convenient visual representation.

## How one could use it?

In order to set up blog engine, one need a hosting with [**django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
and [**git**](http://git-scm.com/).
