Smirnov's seminar 2010-03-29
=== Summary ===
Short extract from talk on problem motivated by geodesic application.
=== Body ===
M. I. Belishev had a talk on Smirnov's seminar. Title: "Symmetric operators,
algebras and inverse problems".

Problem mentioned at the talk was motivated by applied geodesic problem.
There is a method of geological exploration which estimates natural resources
existence and positioning based on measurment of reflected shock-wave
generated by explosion.

One possible sketchy formulation of the problem is as follows. Suppose we have
a compact [Riemannian manifold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold)
with boundary. Let us consider a corresponding [Laplacian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator)
and all of its eigenfunctions. Let us consider eigenvalues of this functions
and values of its normal derivative at boundary:

$$\left\{\lambda_i, \frac{\partial\phi_i}{\partial \nu}\right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$$


We are supposed to construct a manifold which generates the same data.
Laplace originates from wave equation. Data supposingly originates from wave
analyzis.

Approach to the problems consists of the follwing steps.

1. Consider a space of measurable functions \(\mathcal{H} = L_{\infty}\) at the manifold.
2. Construct an algebra \(B(\mathcal{H})\) of all bounded operators defined on \(\mathcal{H}\).
3. Take a sub-algebra which is [von Neumann algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra) of functions related to Laplacian.

It turns out that all information about manifold is concentrated in this
sub-algebra. Set of all maximal elements of sub-algebra, with respect to partial order on
operators, coupled with operator metrics would generate a manifold, isometric to original one.
