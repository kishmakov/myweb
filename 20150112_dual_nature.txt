Dual Nature of the Function
=== Summary ===
An attempt to verbosely describe the difference between function as it is
represented by software and as it is understood by a human.
=== Body ===
This entry is devoted to the difference between two comprehensions of idea
of software program. First comprehension is the one which perceives a program
via its philosophic idea and functional structure. Second comprehension is
the engineering vision of the program which is more localized and devoted to
details. One could figuratively distinguish these perceptions as "from outside"
and "from inside".

This distinction, which can be called topological, is caused by how we approach
the program. Once we approach it from the outside, the program is a black box
for us. We don't know what is inside and we don't need to know it. We are just
interested in its function. On the contrary, creator of the program perceives
its function as a restriction and masters out program internally within
prescribed restriction. Let us come into more detail.

## Outer Perception

\begin{CD}O \times S @>\hat{O}>> O\\@VVV @VVV\\ O_F \times S_F @>\hat{O}_F>> O_F
\end{CD}$$

## Inner Perception
